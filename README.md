## Introduction

I wanted to learn webscraping. I thought about certifications. I thought about text books. But no, I reckon the best way to learn is by doing. I chose a passion which is football, and scraped 2000+ lines of data. Along with multiple attributes, from the Premier League website. Python, selenium and pandas were my weapons of choice. The data I collected was muddy. It needed a bath and make over, SQL was the detergent. Then I had to dress the data to tell the story, this is where tableau came to the rescue. The results is a well designed and interactive dashboard.

## Data Collection

Collecting the data. This is where the idea for the project started. To learn about web scraping. I built python classes, containing multiple functions. These classes are for getting, table stats, team stats, and player stats from the Premier League website. To explain what I did, I will choose TableStatsScraper() as an example.
